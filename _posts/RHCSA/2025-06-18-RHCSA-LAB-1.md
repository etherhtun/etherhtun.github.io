[Vagrant_lab_RHEL9](https://github.com/etherhtun/Vagrant_RHEL9_LAB)

OR Create Own VMS

```bash 
    Bastion Host 
    HD: 30G [Need to install repo]
    Memory :4G 
    CPU : 2 Core 

    Server1&2:
    HD: 30G 
    Memory:4G
    CPU: 2 Core 
```

## Bastion Preparation 

```bash
   swap : 1G
   /    : 15G
   /boot : 512M
   /boto/efi : 512M 

   - GUI installation 
```

## Server1 & 2 
```bash 

   swap : 1G
   /    : 15G
   /boot : 512M
   /boto/efi : 512M 

   - Minimal installation 
```
