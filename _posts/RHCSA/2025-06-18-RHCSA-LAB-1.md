## Lab Preparation 

[Vagrant_lab_RHEL9](https://github.com/etherhtun/Vagrant_RHEL9_LAB)

OR Create Own VMS

```bash 
    Bastion Host 
    HD: 30G [Need to install repo]
    Memory :4G 
    CPU : 2 Core 

    Server1&2:
    HD: 30G 
    Memory:4G
    CPU: 2 Core 
```

## Bastion Preparation 

```bash
   swap : 1G
   /    : 15G
   /boot : 512M
   /boto/efi : 512M 

   - GUI installation 
```

## Server1 & 2 
```bash 

   swap : 1G
   /    : 15G
   /boot : 512M
   /boto/efi : 512M 

   - Minimal installation 
```

### **Q.1 Interrupt the boot process and reset the root password change it to "root" to gain access to system.**

- step 4 : press **e**
- step 5 : move the pointer at the end of kernel command line.
- step 6 : type init=/bin/bash 
- step 7 : press crtl + x

Now switch_root prompt appears. run following commands to change root password.

```
bash-5.1:/# mount -o remount,rw /
bash-5.1:/# passwd root

Changing password for user root. 
New password: toor 
BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters Retype new password: toor 
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully

bash-5.1:/# touch /.autorelabel

bash-5.1:/# exec /usr/lib/systemd/systemd 
```


### **Q.2 Configure IP and hostname as following** Server 1

Host Name --> server1.lab.example.com
IP address --> 192.18.54.20
Gateway --> 192.168.54.1
DNS --> 192.168.54.1

### Answer: -
```
nmtui 

!check 
- hostname 
- route -n
- ip a 
```
Second Option : 
edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
Things needs to be configured are 
```
BOOTPROTO=static
ONBOOT=yes
IPADDR=192.168.54.10
GATEWAY=192.168.54.1
DNS1=192.168.54.1
```
Change hostname in /etc/hostname, this is manual change method.
Need to restart networkmanager to reflective the changes.

groupadd sysadmin 
useradd -G sysadmin harry
useradd -G sysadmin natasha 
useradd sarah  -s /usr/sbin/nologin       #check location with "which nologin" 
```
```
#Change password 
echo "harry:password" | sudo chpasswd
echo "natasha:password" | sudo chpasswd
echo "sarah:password" | sudo chpasswd

Files created inside /shared/sysadmin must automatically get sysadmin group ownership.

### Answer: -
```
sudo mkdir -p /shared/sysadmin
sudo chown :sysadmin /shared/sysadmin 
sudo chmod 2770 /shared/sysadmin 
chmod g+rwxs,o-rwx /shared/sysadm         # alternative
